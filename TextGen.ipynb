    "# Black boxing LSTM\n",
    "In this worksheet LSTM is approached from a black box perspective. Although the workings of LSTM are not overly complicated, see for example the explanation of Chris Olah at http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/, in practice it is not easy to find out what the relationship between the model and the data is. This in contrast to convolutional networks, that allow an intuition to be formed. Still some pragmatic model and data relationships can be established; this worksheet focusses on how input and output data can be shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "# High level conceptual model of an LSTM\n",
    "An LSTM can be seen as a model that models discrete state transitions. The data parts consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input data per discrete state\n",
    "- Output data per discrate state\n",
    "- Internal state built up during previous steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data is merged with the internal state to predict the output data. At each state transition the internal state of the LSTM is updated, and past to the next state. The discrete state transitions are usually fed as event or timeseries into an LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the blackbox model, the trick is to find out how the state is built up in an LSTM, and what predictions should be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shaping the input and output data\n",
    "The example in this worksheet focusses on a single timeseries. The insights generated using this example should generalize to the case of multiple timeseries. The example is text generation. Based on a training text a LSTM will be estimated. Using a seed text subsequently characters will be generated which might contain more of Nietzsches wisdom, total gibberish, or something in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "A LSTM allows for the shaping of both the input and the output data. A first observation: a timeseries, or text in this case, can be fed into an LSTM as a single instance, or it can be cut into (more or less independent) pieces. In the last case the LSTM will more or less be seen as handling multiple observations, but there are subtleties. A second observation: the output can be constrained to a single output per observation, or an output per observation within the timeseries. Lastly, if cutting a single instance into multiple pieces, the internal state in the LSTM can be transfered between the pieces or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, the above statements will be placed in the context of text generation by way of several examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One timeseries, one output\n",
    "Somewhat silly, an entire text minus that last character could be fed into an LSTM to predict the last character. In this case there is a single timeseries and a single output. This setup is silly for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The LSTM only learns to predict a single specific character.\n",
    "- The LSTM assumes that the complete text is a valid context for that character. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technically it would work, but conceptually it would be nonsense. Predicting positive or negative sentiment in the IMDB dataset could be a valid application of this setup, but then there would be more than one time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One timeseries, multiple outputs\n",
    "Changing the setup, one could use the first character to predict the second, the first two to predict the third, and so on. This setup seems to be more sensible: a lot of different characters would be learned. This setup might work. The complexity of the entire text is taken as a single internal state though. Also, the output dimension becomes as long as the input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cutting the timeseries, one output \n",
    "This setup is originally used in the example of fchollet. Take a text, chop it into pieces of 50 characters, and then predict the next characters. The pieces overlap in the sense that the first piece goes from 0-49, the second from 3-52, etc. This setup take away an objection to the previous example. The context for the prediction of a character is 50 characters; basically the sentence before it. This seems reasonable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a more technical timeseries one might conjecture that there is actually a fixed set of mechanims underlying the timeseries. In this case one would not want to chop up the sequences. A somewhat in between option is covered in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cutting the timeseries, one output, statefull state\n",
    "No, that is not a typo in the title. In the last example the text was cut into more or less independent pieces. Conceptually this seems to be a reasonable fit. One could alter the example, by allowing state to flow between the pieces. In other words, at the start the internal state is random or empty. After training a piece, the state is propagated to the next piece. This setup puts back some of the earlier objections. Still, technically it is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four examples about outlined some design considerations for LSTMS. The examples should give an intuition of the basic workings of an LSTM. Some of the examples seem reasonable, some silly, and some in between. Hence the black box. Apart from these considerations, there are ofcourse hyperparameters to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksheet several examples will be illustrated. These illustrations show the coding involved in the different setups, and might create new insights into text prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples are given:\n",
    "- Cutting the timeseries, one output\n",
    "- Cutting the timeseries, one output, statefull state (code changes only)\n",
    "- Cutting the timeseries, multiple outputs\n",
    "\n",
